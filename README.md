# Tempo Test

## Overview
Tempo Test is a fun and interactive web-based game that challenges your sense of rhythm and accuracy. 
The objective of the game is to click to the beat of a playing track and maintain the same tempo even after the beat stops. 
At the end of 20 beats, your score will be displayed, indicating how well you maintained the tempo during the silence.

4. Click or press any key in sync with the beat.
